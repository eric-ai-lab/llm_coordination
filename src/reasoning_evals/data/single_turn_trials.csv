What information about his cards should I reveal to my partner so that he knows to play a card on his turn?

",Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,E,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. ",nan,coordination,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,E,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Reveal Bob's Yellow color cards.,A,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Play Card 4.,E,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.

","Discard Card 1. 
Discard Card 2.","F,G","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Discard Card 1.,G,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

","Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards, Reveal Bob's Blue Color Cards","D, F","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Bob's rank 3 cards.,G,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Reveal Rank 2 cards.,F,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

H. Reveal Bob's Rank 5 Cards",Reveal Bob's Rank 5 cards.,D,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Rank 1 cards.,E,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Reveal Rank 5 cards.,H,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Rank 4 cards,F,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Bob's Green color cards,A,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***

            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.

            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

(e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Reveal Blue color cards.,A,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Reveal Green color cards.,A,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Rank 5 cards.,G,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",Discard Card 1.,G,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives.

",Discard Card 0,"F,G","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Play Card 4.,E,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal rank 2 cards.,D,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
        At each time step I will provide you with the relevant information of the game. I will also provide you with the legal action, help me select the best next action.

",Reveal Yellow color cards.,B,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**

        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Remember I am playing as Alice. Format your response as Explanation: <brief explanation for selecting the move>\nAction:<selected move>. Do not say anything else. Got it?",nan,"tom, implicit comm","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",pick up onion from s1.,E,"In the game Overcooked, I am Alice, my teammate is Bob. 
Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers
We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10).

        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.

",pick up onion from s1.,E,"In the game Overcooked, I am Alice, my teammate is Bob. 
Our environment is circular with two onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0), cookers (c0, c1) and delivery area d0. There are also the shared counters (s0, s1, s2, s3) which can be used to pass objects from one player to the other. Additionally there are kitchen counters (k0 to k15) which can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else.
We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.

",Move to Room 5,B,"I (Alice) am playing the game """"Collab Escape"""" with my partner Bob. We are both ""survivors"". Our objective is to fix the two generators and escape through the exit gate. There is a Killer agent in the game. The Killer's objective is to catch both of us. The Killer can move to connected rooms or stay in the same room. The killer agent is a greedy agent who will move towards the agent closest to it. The game has the following rules:


1. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. 
2. We win the game even if one of us exits throught the exit gate. 
3. All agents (Alice, Bob and Killer) can choose to stay in the current room or move to a connected room.
4. The rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. 
4. Each agent can take only one action in each turn. 
5. Survivors are caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn.
6. Fixing a generator requires consecutive repair actions
7. In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action.

Conventions: 
1. Since fixing the generator requires consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, we should help each other to ensure the repair can be completed.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.
