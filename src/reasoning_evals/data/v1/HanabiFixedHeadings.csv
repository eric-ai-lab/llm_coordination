coordination,Point the 1 ,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. ","Your are a joint actions planning agent.

            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

coordination,Play Clue on the 2 ,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack.

            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**

            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**

",,,Discard Card 0.,,"Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,","""Reveal Bob's G color cards."",","Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***

                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately.

        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.

        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You will assist me with understanding my partner. You will be provided with the rules of a game, conventions, my partner's selected action and my latest state information after my partner took their action. You will respond with a summary of my partner’s beliefs, intentions, and optional implicit communications based on the action they took and the resulting updated state.

Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points.

                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately.

",,,Discard Card 0.,,"Play Card 2.',","""Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards."",","Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,",Reveal R2 to Bob.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Reveal partner's rank 5 cards.,,"Play Card 2.',","""Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards."",","Reveal Bob's B color cards., '",Reveal Bob's Rank 2 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Reveal partner's rank 1 cards.,,"Discard Card 0.',","Discard Card 4.',","Discard Card 1.',",Reveal Bob's R color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Reveal partner's rank 3 cards.,,"Discard Card 2.',","Discard Card 0.',","Discard Card 0.',",Discard Card 0.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Discard Card 0.,,"Play Card 1.',","""Reveal Bob's Y color cards."",","Discard Card 0.',",Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,Play Card 3.,,"Play Card 3.',","Discard Card 0.',","Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points.

"tom, coordination","Chose correct kind of clue (rank, not color)","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**

",,,,,"Reveal Bob's R color cards.,","""Reveal Bob's Y color cards."",","Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Reveal partner's rank 5 cards.,,"Play Card 2.',","""Reveal Bob's W color cards."",","Reveal Bob's W color cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 5 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Play Card 0.,,"Play Card 2.',","Discard Card 0.',","Reveal Bob's R color cards.,",Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,,,"Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,","""Reveal Bob's R color cards."",","Reveal Bob's R color cards.,",Reveal Bob's G color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,Reveal partner's rank 1 cards.,,"Discard Card 3.',","""Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards."",","Reveal Bob's R color cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

"coordination, env awareness",Save last 4,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

"implicit comms, coordination","Green clue saves 5, shows playable 3 and discardable 3","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

"tom, implicit comm","New card is color clued, play it","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand.

",,,Reveal partner's R color cards.,,"Play Card 0.',","""Reveal Bob's G color cards."",","Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.

(e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.

",,,Play Card 2.,,"Play Card 2.',","""Reveal Bob's G color cards."",","Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Reveal partner's G color cards.,,"Discard Card 0.',","""Reveal Bob's Y color cards."",","Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 1 Y cards.???,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Discard Card 0.,,"Reveal Bob's R color cards.,","""Reveal Bob's Y color cards."",","Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,",Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

",,,Play Card 3.,,"Play Card 2.',","Discard Card 0.',","Reveal Bob's B color cards.,",Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,Reveal partner's rank 5 cards.,,"Play Card 2.',","Discard Card 1.',","Play Card 0.',",Play Card 2.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:

                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,Play Card 0.,,"Play Card 3.',","Discard Card 0.',","Discard Card 0."",",Discard Card 1.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points.

        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

"
"coordination, env awareness",Clue both 2's for immediate play,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

(e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.

        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,Play Card 0.,,Play Card 0.',"""Reveal Bob's G color cards.""",Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,Reveal Bob's Blue color cards.,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives.
