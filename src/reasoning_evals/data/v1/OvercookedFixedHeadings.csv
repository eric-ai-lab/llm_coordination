pick up plate when other agent is placing third onion,Cramped Room,"In the game Overcooked, I am Alice, my teammate is Bob. 
Our environment is rectangular with 2 onions dispensers (o0, o1), cooker (c0), plate dispenser (p0) and delivery area (d0). Additionally there are kitchen counters (k0 to k8) which can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers.
We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible","I'll provide my action history, current state, teammate's status, and my possible actions.

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else.

understand the concept of shared counters and distance of partner to shared counter,Forced Coordination,"In the game Overcooked, I am Alice, my teammate is Bob. 
Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers

Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation.

        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

You will be provided with the the latest state information after my partner took their last action. You will respond with a summary of my partner’s beliefs, intentions and possible next actions. You will also make a suggestion of what I should do next based on my partner's position and inventory. Think about the environment layout, think about Bob's location, think about my location.
