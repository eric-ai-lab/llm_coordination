Since Bob is in Room 2, the thief might avoid going there. However, if the thief predicts that Bob will move to Room 3 to intercept him, the thief might opt to move to Room 2 as a counter. To prevent the thief from escaping to Room 4, Alice should move to Room 5. This will position Alice to either catch the thief if he moves to Room 4 or to cut off the escape route to Room 5 if the thief stays in Room 3 or moves to Room 2. Since the door between Room 3 and 4 is open, moving to Room 5 is a strategic choice to close in on the thief. Bob's best move would likely be to wait in Room 2, forcing the thief to choose between entering a room with Bob or moving towards Alice.

You are an action verification agent. I will provide you with the current state of the game and my next selected action.  You need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2.Layout Verification: The suggested action is in line with connections of the layout including doors and buttons. Think about the action, and the current positioning of all agents, doors and buttons. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***both*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise. ","Analysis: To catch the thief in the minimum number of steps, the thief needs to move to Room 2 or Room 4, and either Alice or Bob needs to be in the connecting room. Since Bob is currently in Room 2, the best option for Alice would be to move to Room 1, allowing Bob to move to Room 2 and trap the thief when they move to Room 3 or Room 4. The thief might move to Room 2 to escape from Room 3, or they might try to escape through the open door to Room 4.

Action: Move to Room 1.</s>","Analysis:
The thief is in Room 3, and Bob is in Room 2. They are not yet in a position to trap the thief. If Bob moves to Room 3 in the next step, he might be able to trap the thief, but it would still take two more steps for me (Alice) to reach Room 3 and help Bob. Therefore, I should try to accelerate the process.

If I (Alice) move to Room 1 and close the door between Room 1 and 2, the thief will be trapped in Room 2 with Bob in the next step. However, this would also trap Bob in Room 2 with the thief. This might not be the ideal solution as it may lead to unnecessary conflicts between Bob and the thief.

A better approach would be to open the door between Room 3 and 4 by moving to Room 9 and then moving Bob to Room 3 using the open pathway between Room 2 and 3. This would allow Bob to trap the thief in Room 3 in the next step, and I (Alice) can follow Bob to Room 3 in two more steps (by moving to Room 5 and then to Room 3) to help Bob.

The thief's next action could be moving to Room 4 or staying in Room 3. Bob's next action should be moving to Room 3 to trap the thief.

You are an action verification agent. I will provide you with the current state of the game and my next selected action.  You need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2.Safety: It won't lead to the thief escaping. Think about the action, and the current positioning of all agents, doors and buttons. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***both*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise. ","Analysis: The thief is in Room 5 and there are only two doors connecting to it. One is in Room 2 which is currently open, and the other is in Room 4 which is controlled by a button in Room 8.

To coordinate with Bob, Alice can close the door in Room 8 to trap the thief in Room 5, forcing them to move to Room 6 where they can be easily caught by Bob or Alice.

Bob's next action: Bob should move to Room 5 to catch the thief.

Thief's next action: The thief might attempt to move to Room 2 or Room 4, but they will be trapped in Room 5 once the door in Room 8 is closed.

Action: Alice moves to Room 8 to close the door.</s>","Analysis:
The thief is in Room 5, which is connected to Room 4. If Bob moves to Room 4, he could potentially trap the thief.

6,Collab Escape,Killer block Exit Gate,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 rooms (room 1 to 7). Room 1 and 2 have generators, and room 7 has the exit gate. 
- Room 1 is directly connected to room 2, 5, and 7; 
- Room 2 is directly connected to room 1 and 3; 
- Room 3 is directly connected to room 2, 4, and 5; 
- Room 4 is directly connected to room 3 and 5; 
- Room 5 is directly connected to room 1, 3, 4, and 6; 
- Room 6 is directly connected to room 5 and 7; 
- Room 7 is directly connected to room 1, and 6.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Your teammate Bob is likely to move towards the exit gate in room 7, as it is the primary objective to win the game. Since the killer is in room 7 and will not move this turn, Bob should avoid entering room 7 directly to prevent getting caught. 

As Alice, you have the advantage of being in room 2, which is connected to room 1, and room 1 is connected to room 7 where the exit gate is. Since the killer is currently in room 7 and will stay there, moving to room 1 is not safe for this turn. However, you can position yourself to escape in the next turn. Moving to room 3 does not bring you closer to the exit, and waiting is not productive.

Bob's best move would be to go from room 4 to room 5. This move positions him closer to room 6, which then leads to room 7, allowing him to escape in the following turn if the killer moves away from the exit gate.

For you, moving to room 6 is the best action. It sets you up to escape on the next turn if the killer leaves room 7, and it avoids the risk of entering a room with the killer. Bob and you cannot coordinate directly, but by moving to different rooms that both lead to room 7, you increase the chances that at least one of you can make it to the exit on the following turn, securing the win.

8,Collab Escape,Leading Killer away from teammate,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 rooms (room 1 to 7). Room 1 and 2 have generators, and room 7 has the exit gate. 
- Room 1 is directly connected to room 2, 5, and 7; 
- Room 2 is directly connected to room 1 and 3; 
- Room 3 is directly connected to room 2, 4, and 5; 
- Room 4 is directly connected to room 3 and 5; 
- Room 5 is directly connected to room 1, 3, 4, and 6; 
- Room 6 is directly connected to room 5 and 7; 
- Room 7 is directly connected to room 1, and 6.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Our objective is to fix the two generators and escape through the exit gate. There is a Killer agent in the game. The Killer's objective is to catch both of us. The Killer can move to connected rooms or stay in the same room. The killer agent is a greedy agent who will move towards the agent closest to it. The game has the following rules:


1. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. 
2. We win the game even if one of us exits throught the exit gate. 
3. All agents (Alice, Bob and Killer) can choose to stay in the current room or move to a connected room.
4. The rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms.

Since Bob is in room 5, which is connected to room 3, and the killer is moving to room 3, it is likely that Bob will move to either room 1 to start fixing the generator or to room 6 to avoid the killer's path and prepare to move towards the exit once the generator in room 1 is fixed. Bob is likely to guess that Alice will not stay in room 3. Since the generator in room 2 is already fixed, Alice has no reason to go there, and room 5 will likely be avoided since Bob is already there and it's a connecting room to the killer's destination.

Given that Alice needs to avoid the killer, her best move would be to either room 4 or room 2. Moving to room 4 seems to be the safest option as it keeps her away from the killer's known path and allows her to potentially fix the generator in room 1 in the future. Room 2 is less desirable since it doesn't immediately contribute to the objective of fixing the remaining generator. Bob, knowing that Alice is likely to avoid the killer, might decide to head toward room 1 to work on the generator, assuming that Alice will not risk going to room 5 and that going to room 6 does not help progress the game at this moment.

Got it? ","Analysis: Bob might move to room 4 to help fix the generator there, as it is the only unattended generator and having it fixed would bring the team closer to their goal. The killer will move to room 3, as that is where Alice is.

Bob's next action: move to room 4.
My next action: move to room 2. This allows me to help fix the remaining generator, which is crucial for the team's success, while avoiding the killer's attention.

Action: move to room 2.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information provided, I guess that Bob will move to Room 4 to fix the generator there since it is a connected room to his current location and there is no guarantee of safety if he moves to Room 1 or 2 where the killer might be heading. If I move to Room 2, the killer will be alerted to my presence and might decide to chase me, making it difficult for Bob to fix the generator in Room 1. If I move to Room 4, I might risk being in the same room as Bob, which is not ideal. If I wait, I will be in the same room as the killer in the next turn, leading to a high chance of getting caught.

The killer will not reach room 1 in the next turn based on the current information. Since you both cannot communicate directly, it's best to make a decision that aligns with the common goal of fixing the generator while minimizing the risk of being caught by the killer. 

Bob should assume that you, Alice, will start fixing the generator in room 1 because it is the only generator that needs fixing, and it's safe to do so this turn. Therefore, Bob's best action for the team's common good would be to either assist in fixing the generator, which would expedite the process, or to move to another room to avoid the killer's suspicion in the next turn. 

Since the killer is currently moving to room 3, Bob could choose to move to room 5 or room 7. Moving to room 5 would allow Bob to be in a central position to react to the killer's next move, but it might also put him at risk if the killer decides to move to room 5 next. Moving to room 7 would be a safer choice, as it is further away from the killer's current trajectory and close to the exit gate for when it's time to escape. However, this would not contribute to fixing the generator in the current turn.

Given that the generator needs multiple consecutive actions to be fixed and there is currently no imminent threat at room 1, the best course of action for Bob could be to stay and help fix the generator.

Got it? ","Analysis: Given the current situation, I believe Bob will move to room 5 to help fix the generator there as it is directly connected to room 1 and has multiple connections to other rooms. This will make it a strategic location for the team, as it will make it harder for the killer to predict our movements.

As for my next action, I will move to room 2. By doing this, I can help Bob fix the generator in room 1 from a safer location since the killer will be moving away from us. Additionally, fixing the generator in room 2 will provide us with an alternative escape route through room 5 and 6 if needed. This strategy also allows us to keep the killer's attention away from our team, increasing our chances of survival.

Action: Alice moves to room 2.</s>","Analysis: The killer is moving towards room 3, so it would be dangerous for both of us to stay in room 1. Since Bob and I are together, we can either move to room 5 or room 7 together. However, moving to room 5 would mean splitting up later, which may not be the best option if we want to stick together. On the other hand, moving to room 7 will allow us to be closer to the exit gate, and if we are lucky, we might be able to escape together. Considering the killer's movement, Bob will likely move to room 5 or 7 as well.

Action: Move to room 7.

This action will bring us closer to the exit gate and allow us to escape more quickly if we manage to fix the remaining generators. It also ensures that we are not in the same room as the killer, reducing the risk of getting caught.</s>","Partner Aware Planning, Environmental Awareness","My name is Alice. I am in room 1.

11,Collab Escape,Getting caught,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 rooms (room 1 to 7). Room 1 and 2 have generators, and room 7 has the exit gate. 
- Room 1 is directly connected to room 2, 5, and 7; 
- Room 2 is directly connected to room 1 and 3; 
- Room 3 is directly connected to room 2, 4, and 5; 
- Room 4 is directly connected to room 3 and 5; 
- Room 5 is directly connected to room 1, 3, 4, and 6; 
- Room 6 is directly connected to room 5 and 7; 
- Room 7 is directly connected to room 1, and 6.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Since the killer is moving to room 1 after this turn, and you (Alice) are currently in room 1, you should not attempt to fix the generator this turn as that would result in you getting caught. Bob is in room 6, and the best action for him would likely be to move towards room 7 to be ready to escape once the final generator is fixed. It's reasonable to assume that Bob will either wait in room 6 to remain safe or move to room 7 to be closer to the exit gate. Since the killer is moving to room 1, it is likely safe for Bob to wait, anticipating that you will fix the generator in the subsequent turn and then both of you can attempt to escape.

For your next action, you should avoid getting caught by the killer. Since the killer is heading to room 1, you should move to a connected room. Room 2 is already fixed, so there's no point in going there. Room 5 is a central hub that connects to many other rooms, which gives you more options to evade the killer in future turns. Room 7 is the room with the exit gate, but going there now doesn't benefit you because you still need to fix the generator in room 1.

Therefore, the best action for you is to move to room 5. This puts distance between you and the killer while keeping you close to room 1, allowing you to return to fix the generator in a future turn when it's safe. Bob should either wait in room 6 or move to room 7 to be ready for the escape.

Given the current situation, the exit gate is open, and the killer is moving to the Backyard area from the Gate area. Since both generators are fixed, the primary goal now is to escape through the exit gate without getting caught by the killer.

As Alice, you are currently in the Kitchen area, which is connected to the Forest area and the Parking area. Since the killer is moving to the Backyard area, you should avoid moving there. Your best bet is to move towards the exit gate while minimizing the risk of encountering the killer.

Bob, being in the Warehouse area, has a direct path to the Backyard area, which he should avoid since the killer is heading there. His best move would be to either wait in the Warehouse if he thinks the killer will not move there after reaching the Backyard or to move to the Parking area to position himself for an escape in the following turns.

Considering the killer's next move to the Backyard area, you should move to the Forest area, which keeps you safe from the killer's current path and positions you for a potential escape through the Backyard to the Gate area in the next turn.

Once the generator is fixed, we can both make our way to the Gate area and escape together.

Action: I will wait in the Kitchen area.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information you provided, the killer is moving towards the Backyard area from the Gate area. This means that neither you nor Bob is in immediate danger, as there is no path directly connecting the Gate area to the Kitchen or Warehouse areas. However, if the killer continues moving in the same direction, they could potentially reach the Warehouse area (where Bob is) in the next turn.

As for Bob's actions, I'm assuming that he will either move towards a connected area or wait in the Warehouse area. Moving towards a connected area might be a good idea if he wants to avoid the killer or help you fix the remaining generator in the Forest area. On the other hand, waiting in the Warehouse area could be a good strategy if he wants to ensure that the generator in the Warehouse area stays fixed and attract the killer's attention.

Considering the situation, I think the best action for you to take would be to move towards the Forest area. This would achieve a few things:

1. It would allow you to help fix the remaining generator in the Forest area, which would contribute to the team's goal of escaping the map.
2. It would also allow you to be in closer proximity to Bob, which would make it easier for you to coordinate your actions and communicate with each other.
3. Moving towards the Forest area would also put some distance between you and the killer, which would reduce the risk of getting caught.

Of course, if you have reason to believe that Bob is planning to move towards the Backyard area in order to distract the killer or lead them away from the Warehouse area, then you might want to consider moving towards the Parking area instead. This would allow you to meet up with Bob and potentially flank the killer together.

9,Collab Escape,,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 areas listed as follow. Forest and Warehouse areas have generators, and Gate area has the exit gate. 
- Parking area is directly connected to Warehouse and Kitchen; 
- Warehouse area is directly connected to Parking, Centerhub and Backyard; 
- Backyard area is directly connected to Warehouse, Centerhub, Gate and Forest; 
- Centerhub area is directly connected to Warehouse, Backyard and Kitchen; 
- Kitchen area is directly connected to Centerhub, Parking and Forest; 
- Forest area is directly connected to Kitchen and Backyard.
- Gate area is only directly connected to Backyard.

Connected areas are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected areas. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors cannot be caught when they are moving between areas but Survivors will get caught if they end in the same area with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected areas, wait in current area, or fixing generators in the current area.

Alice should therefore avoid staying in Centerhub or moving to the Backyard to prevent getting caught. Since Bob is in the Forest area and he was fixing the generator, it's reasonable to assume that Bob will continue to fix the generator, assuming he believes Alice will successfully divert the killer's attention away from him.

For the team's common good, Alice should move to an area that will not intersect with the killer's pursuit and allows Bob to safely continue fixing the generator in the Forest area. Moving to the Kitchen would be a safe bet, as it would put more distance between Alice and the killer and does not directly connect to the Backyard, where the killer currently is. This move also positions Alice to potentially fix the generator in the Forest area later on or to move towards the exit once the generator is fixed.

I can't be certain about Bob's next action, but it's likely that he will continue fixing the generator to ensure that it gets completed. As for my next action, since the killer is currently in the Backyard area, it might be a good idea for me to move to the Kitchen area to avoid being caught by the killer. This will also give me an opportunity to help Bob by fixing the generator in the Warehouse area when it's my turn again.

The killer is aware of Alice's location and is in the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Forest area where Bob is. Given that the killer is likely to move towards the seen survivor (Bob) in the next turn, Alice should prioritize moving towards a safer area.

Bob's best course of action in this situation would be to finish fixing the generator in the Forest area as quickly as possible and then move to the Backyard area. By doing so, Bob can create a diversion, attracting the killer's attention and providing Alice with an opportunity to move to a safer location.

The cooker has 2 onions but is off, which means it needs a tomato to complete the recipe for the onion soup. Since Bob is holding a tomato, it is likely that he will place the tomato in the cooker next. Therefore, your best move is to prepare for the next steps after the current soup is cooking. Picking up a plate would be the most strategic action as you will need it to serve the cooked soup once it's ready. This will streamline the process and make sure you are ready to plate the soup as soon as it's done cooking.

Right now, the cooker has 2 onions, so Bob doesn't need me to pick up an onion. Instead, I can pick up an onion from the cooker and place it on the counter, so that Bob can easily access it when he's ready to start cooking. This will also free up the cooker for me to use later. Since I can only carry one item at a time, I will pick up the onion first and then pick up the plate.
