pick up plate when other agent is placing third onion,Cramped Room,"In the game Overcooked, I am Alice, my teammate is Bob. 
Our environment is rectangular with 2 onions dispensers (o0, o1), cooker (c0), plate dispenser (p0) and delivery area (d0). Additionally there are kitchen counters (k0 to k8) which can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers.
We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible","I'll provide my action history, current state, teammate's status, and my possible actions.

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time.

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

Our environment is split into two partitions, one with each player. In the right partition, Alice has access to cookers (c0, c1),  delivery area (d0) and kitchen counters (k6, k8, k12). In the left partition, Bob has access to onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0) and kitchen counters (k1, k10). Kitchen counters can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else. Both players have access to shared counters (s0, s1, s2) which can be used to transfer onions and plates depending on the situation. Note that the objects on the shared counters can be accessed by both players. Objects on counters can be picked up later and should be considered as they may be closer than items in dispensers

        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.

Our environment is circular with two onion dispensers (o0, o1), plate dispenser (p0), cookers (c0, c1) and delivery area d0. There are also the shared counters (s0, s1, s2, s3) which can be used to pass objects from one player to the other. Additionally there are kitchen counters (k0 to k15) which can be used to temporarily store onions and plates while you do something else.
We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.

We must coordinate to make soup with 3 onions. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. My goal is to maximize the number of cooked soups and deliveries. The game has the following rules:
        - A player can only pick up one onion or plate at a time. 
        - A soup can only be loaded onto plate by a player if they are holding a plate.
        - Selected action must be in the list of available actions        

Bob and I have decided to follow the following conventions: 
        - If we are in the same section of workspace, we will minimize our movement to avoid getting in each other's way.  
        - We will start preparing the next soup while the one before is being cooked/delivered.
        - We will make optimal use of all available cookers, and counters.
        - We will take actions that ensures as many soups are delivered as possible

You will be provided with the the latest state information after my partner took their last action. You will respond with a summary of my partnerâ€™s beliefs, intentions and possible next actions. You will also make a suggestion of what I should do next based on my partner's position and inventory. Think about the environment layout, think about Bob's location, think about my location.

Point the 1 ,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. ","Your are a joint actions planning agent.

            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.

            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**

        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens.

        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.

        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.",coordination,,"Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.",coordination,,"Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.",coordination,,"Reveal Bob's B color cards., '",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Discard Card 1.',",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.

Save-clue on last of type,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens.

            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

Make the card clear,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's B color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's rank 1 cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's W color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's R color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's R color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

Clear save 5,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left)

            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","implicit comms, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's rank 3 cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

            - Positions are referenced from left to right.

            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**

Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, implicit comm",,"Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","implicit comms, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's B color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","implicit comms, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's G color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, coordination",,"Reveal Bob's Y color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.

You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's B color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

"No clues remaing, discard only unlclued card",,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

"No clues remaing, discard only unlclued card",,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack.

Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens.

                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points.

            - Positions are referenced from left to right.

            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player

(e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.

        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's W color cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points.

        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","coordination, env awareness",,"Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,",,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player

        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.

",,,,,,"The card game Hanabi has the following rules:
        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        - Players can only chose an action from the Available Legal Actions.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        I am Alice, playing the card game Hanabi with my partner Bob. We have agreed to follow these conventions: Conventions:
        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You can take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. 
You are an action verification agent for games. I will provide you with an action and you need to check whether the action satisfies the criteria: 1. Rule Following: It follows to the rules of the game. 2. Convention Following: It adheres to the mentioned conventions. 3. Safety: It won't lead to the game ending immediately. Think about the action, the current state of the stack and the available lives and reveal tokens. End you response with ""Verification: Okay"" if selected action follows ***all three*** criteria and ""Verification: Not Okay"" otherwise.","tom, implicit comm",,Reveal Bob's rank 2 cards.,,,,,Hanabi,"It is currently My (Alice) turn.

Since Bob is in Room 2, the thief might avoid going there. However, if the thief predicts that Bob will move to Room 3 to intercept him, the thief might opt to move to Room 2 as a counter. To prevent the thief from escaping to Room 4, Alice should move to Room 5. This will position Alice to either catch the thief if he moves to Room 4 or to cut off the escape route to Room 5 if the thief stays in Room 3 or moves to Room 2. Since the door between Room 3 and 4 is open, moving to Room 5 is a strategic choice to close in on the thief. Bob's best move would likely be to wait in Room 2, forcing the thief to choose between entering a room with Bob or moving towards Alice.

Action: Move to Room 5","Analysis: To catch the thief in the minimum number of steps, the thief needs to move to Room 2 or Room 4, and either Alice or Bob needs to be in the connecting room. Since Bob is currently in Room 2, the best option for Alice would be to move to Room 1, allowing Bob to move to Room 2 and trap the thief when they move to Room 3 or Room 4. The thief might move to Room 2 to escape from Room 3, or they might try to escape through the open door to Room 4.

Action: Move to Room 1.</s>","Analysis:
The thief is in Room 3, and Bob is in Room 2. They are not yet in a position to trap the thief. If Bob moves to Room 3 in the next step, he might be able to trap the thief, but it would still take two more steps for me (Alice) to reach Room 3 and help Bob. Therefore, I should try to accelerate the process.

If I (Alice) move to Room 1 and close the door between Room 1 and 2, the thief will be trapped in Room 2 with Bob in the next step. However, this would also trap Bob in Room 2 with the thief. This might not be the ideal solution as it may lead to unnecessary conflicts between Bob and the thief.

A better approach would be to open the door between Room 3 and 4 by moving to Room 9 and then moving Bob to Room 3 using the open pathway between Room 2 and 3. This would allow Bob to trap the thief in Room 3 in the next step, and I (Alice) can follow Bob to Room 3 in two more steps (by moving to Room 5 and then to Room 3) to help Bob.

The thief's next action could be moving to Room 4 or staying in Room 3. Bob's next action should be moving to Room 3 to trap the thief.

Bob is in Room 9 and has control over the door between Room 1 and 2. If Bob opens the door, the thief might anticipate this and move to Room 3 to avoid capture. To optimize the chances of trapping the thief, it would be strategic for Bob to open the door while Alice moves towards Room 6, which would place her in a position to catch the thief if he attempts to circle around through Room 6 in subsequent turns. The thief may guess that Bob will open the door and thus may move to Room 3 to escape. However, if the thief stays in Room 2, anticipating that Alice will move, Bob could then move to Room 6 in his next turn to close off that route for the thief.

Action: Move to Room 6","Analysis: Bob should move to Room 8 to open the door between Room 3 and 4, forcing the thief to move towards Room 4 or 5. Alice will move to Room 6 to intercept the thief if they move towards Room 5, as it is the only possible direction for the thief to go after Bob opens the door. The thief might attempt to escape through Room 3 if they notice Bob's movement, but they will be trapped if they try to go through the closed door between Room 3 and 4.

The thief is in Room 2, but the door to that room is currently closed. Bob is at a distance, in Room 9. If we want to catch the thief, we need to open the door to Room 2. I'm assuming Bob will try to open the door in Room 9, which controls the door between Room 1 and 2. If I move to Room 6, the thief might move to Room 3 or Room 6, making it harder to catch the thief.

Thief's next action: Stay in Room 2 or move to Room 3 or Room 6

To catch the thief more efficiently, I should stay in Room 1 and wait for Bob to open the door.

Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 rooms (room 1 to 7). Room 1 and 2 have generators, and room 7 has the exit gate.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Your teammate Bob is likely to move towards the exit gate in room 7, as it is the primary objective to win the game. Since the killer is in room 7 and will not move this turn, Bob should avoid entering room 7 directly to prevent getting caught. 

As Alice, you have the advantage of being in room 2, which is connected to room 1, and room 1 is connected to room 7 where the exit gate is. Since the killer is currently in room 7 and will stay there, moving to room 1 is not safe for this turn. However, you can position yourself to escape in the next turn. Moving to room 3 does not bring you closer to the exit, and waiting is not productive.

Bob's best move would be to go from room 4 to room 5. This move positions him closer to room 6, which then leads to room 7, allowing him to escape in the following turn if the killer moves away from the exit gate.

For you, moving to room 6 is the best action. It sets you up to escape on the next turn if the killer leaves room 7, and it avoids the risk of entering a room with the killer. Bob and you cannot coordinate directly, but by moving to different rooms that both lead to room 7, you increase the chances that at least one of you can make it to the exit on the following turn, securing the win.

Action: Move to room 6","Analysis: With the killer in room 7 and both of us safe from the killer's reach since our rooms are not directly connected, it would be best for Bob to move towards the exit gate in room 7 to ensure a quick escape for the team. As for me, I will move to room 1 to help fix the generator if it has not been finished yet, as having all generators fixed increases the chances of a successful escape. While I am repairing the generator, Bob can provide a distraction by moving around the map, luring the killer away from me, and keeping it busy, thus reducing the risk of getting caught.

Action: Alice moves to room 1 to help fix the generator. Bob moves to room 6 to lure the killer and create a diversion.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information provided, Bob is in room 4 and the killer is staying in room 7.

",CollabGames,,,,,,,,,8.0,Leading Killer away from teammate,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 rooms (room 1 to 7). Room 1 and 2 have generators, and room 7 has the exit gate. 
- Room 1 is directly connected to room 2, 5, and 7; 
- Room 2 is directly connected to room 1 and 3; 
- Room 3 is directly connected to room 2, 4, and 5; 
- Room 4 is directly connected to room 3 and 5; 
- Room 5 is directly connected to room 1, 3, 4, and 6; 
- Room 6 is directly connected to room 5 and 7; 
- Room 7 is directly connected to room 1, and 6.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Generator in room 1 still needs 2 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. Available Actions: [move to room 2, move to room 5, move to room 4, wait.]",,"Analysis: Since the killer is certainly moving to the room where Alice is (room 3), Alice must move out of room 3 to avoid getting caught. Since Bob is in room 5, which is connected to room 3, and the killer is moving to room 3, it is likely that Bob will move to either room 1 to start fixing the generator or to room 6 to avoid the killer's path and prepare to move towards the exit once the generator in room 1 is fixed. Bob is likely to guess that Alice will not stay in room 3. Since the generator in room 2 is already fixed, Alice has no reason to go there, and room 5 will likely be avoided since Bob is already there and it's a connecting room to the killer's destination.

Given that Alice needs to avoid the killer, her best move would be to either room 4 or room 2. Moving to room 4 seems to be the safest option as it keeps her away from the killer's known path and allows her to potentially fix the generator in room 1 in the future. Room 2 is less desirable since it doesn't immediately contribute to the objective of fixing the remaining generator. Bob, knowing that Alice is likely to avoid the killer, might decide to head toward room 1 to work on the generator, assuming that Alice will not risk going to room 5 and that going to room 6 does not help progress the game at this moment.

Action: Alice should move to room 4.","Analysis: Bob might move to room 4 to help fix the generator there, as it is the only unattended generator and having it fixed would bring the team closer to their goal. The killer will move to room 3, as that is where Alice is.

Bob's next action: move to room 4.
My next action: move to room 2. This allows me to help fix the remaining generator, which is crucial for the team's success, while avoiding the killer's attention.

Action: move to room 2.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information provided, I guess that Bob will move to Room 4 to fix the generator there since it is a connected room to his current location and there is no guarantee of safety if he moves to Room 1 or 2 where the killer might be heading. If I move to Room 2, the killer will be alerted to my presence and might decide to chase me, making it difficult for Bob to fix the generator in Room 1. If I move to Room 4, I might risk being in the same room as Bob, which is not ideal. If I wait, I will be in the same room as the killer in the next turn, leading to a high chance of getting caught.

Action: I should move to Room 5 to join Bob. Although this action might reveal our position to the killer, it ensures both generators in Rooms 1 and 2 get fixed faster, allowing us to complete the objective and open the exit gate. After moving to Room 5, Bob and I can plan our next move accordingly, depending on the killer's position.

Available Actions: [move to room 5, move to room 7, wait.]",,"Analysis: Since both Alice and Bob are in room 1 and the killer is moving to room 3, it is safe for at least one of you to stay in room 1 and start fixing the generator. The killer will not reach room 1 in the next turn based on the current information. Since you both cannot communicate directly, it's best to make a decision that aligns with the common goal of fixing the generator while minimizing the risk of being caught by the killer. 

Bob should assume that you, Alice, will start fixing the generator in room 1 because it is the only generator that needs fixing, and it's safe to do so this turn. Therefore, Bob's best action for the team's common good would be to either assist in fixing the generator, which would expedite the process, or to move to another room to avoid the killer's suspicion in the next turn. 

Since the killer is currently moving to room 3, Bob could choose to move to room 5 or room 7. Moving to room 5 would allow Bob to be in a central position to react to the killer's next move, but it might also put him at risk if the killer decides to move to room 5 next. Moving to room 7 would be a safer choice, as it is further away from the killer's current trajectory and close to the exit gate for when it's time to escape. However, this would not contribute to fixing the generator in the current turn.

Given that the generator needs multiple consecutive actions to be fixed and there is currently no imminent threat at room 1, the best course of action for Bob could be to stay and help fix the generator.

Action: Bob should stay in room 1 and help fix the generator.","Analysis: Given the current situation, I believe Bob will move to room 5 to help fix the generator there as it is directly connected to room 1 and has multiple connections to other rooms. This will make it a strategic location for the team, as it will make it harder for the killer to predict our movements.

As for my next action, I will move to room 2. By doing this, I can help Bob fix the generator in room 1 from a safer location since the killer will be moving away from us. Additionally, fixing the generator in room 2 will provide us with an alternative escape route through room 5 and 6 if needed. This strategy also allows us to keep the killer's attention away from our team, increasing our chances of survival.

Action: Alice moves to room 2.</s>","Analysis: The killer is moving towards room 3, so it would be dangerous for both of us to stay in room 1. Since Bob and I are together, we can either move to room 5 or room 7 together. However, moving to room 5 would mean splitting up later, which may not be the best option if we want to stick together. On the other hand, moving to room 7 will allow us to be closer to the exit gate, and if we are lucky, we might be able to escape together. Considering the killer's movement, Bob will likely move to room 5 or 7 as well.

Action: Move to room 7.

Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Survivors are safe if they are not in the same room with the killer. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

These connected rooms are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected rooms. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors will get caught if they are in the same room with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected rooms or fixing generators in the current room.

Do not say anything else. Got it?","My name is Alice. I am in room 1. Bob is in room 6. I was fixing the generator and there is only one more fix needed, which could be done before getting caught. Currently, we have information that the killer will move to the room 1 after this turn. Generator in room 1 still needs 1 fix. Generator in room 2 is fixed. The exit gate is closed. Available Actions: [move to room 5, move to room 7, move to room 2, fix generator in room 1, wait.]",,"Analysis:
Since the killer is moving to room 1 after this turn, and you (Alice) are currently in room 1, you should not attempt to fix the generator this turn as that would result in you getting caught. Bob is in room 6, and the best action for him would likely be to move towards room 7 to be ready to escape once the final generator is fixed. It's reasonable to assume that Bob will either wait in room 6 to remain safe or move to room 7 to be closer to the exit gate. Since the killer is moving to room 1, it is likely safe for Bob to wait, anticipating that you will fix the generator in the subsequent turn and then both of you can attempt to escape.

For your next action, you should avoid getting caught by the killer. Since the killer is heading to room 1, you should move to a connected room. Room 2 is already fixed, so there's no point in going there. Room 5 is a central hub that connects to many other rooms, which gives you more options to evade the killer in future turns. Room 7 is the room with the exit gate, but going there now doesn't benefit you because you still need to fix the generator in room 1.

Therefore, the best action for you is to move to room 5. This puts distance between you and the killer while keeping you close to room 1, allowing you to return to fix the generator in a future turn when it's safe. Bob should either wait in room 6 or move to room 7 to be ready for the escape.

Action: Move to room 5","Analysis: Bob is likely to move towards the generator in room 1 to help fix it since it is the only unfinished one and the exit gate is still closed. This action would put him in danger of getting caught by the killer. I will move to room 5 to avoid being in the same room as the killer and to ensure that Bob can safely finish fixing the generator in room 1 without attracting the killer's attention.

Action: I will move to room 5.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information provided, I assume that Bob will move towards me (room 1 or 5) in order to collaborate on fixing the generator or to divert the killer's attention. If Bob moves to room 1, it would put us both at risk of getting caught since the killer is coming there next turn. If Bob moves to room 5, we can complete the generator fix and escape through room 7, but this action may attract the killer to Bob's location.

My selected action is for Bob to move to room 5, allowing me to fix the generator in room 1 and escape through the exit gate in room 7. I will then move to room 5, and we can proceed with our escape together.

Generator in Warehouse is fixed. The exit gate in the Gate is opened. Available Actions: [move to Parking area, move to Forest area, wait.]",,"Analysis:
Given the current situation, the exit gate is open, and the killer is moving to the Backyard area from the Gate area. Since both generators are fixed, the primary goal now is to escape through the exit gate without getting caught by the killer.

As Alice, you are currently in the Kitchen area, which is connected to the Forest area and the Parking area. Since the killer is moving to the Backyard area, you should avoid moving there. Your best bet is to move towards the exit gate while minimizing the risk of encountering the killer.

Bob, being in the Warehouse area, has a direct path to the Backyard area, which he should avoid since the killer is heading there. His best move would be to either wait in the Warehouse if he thinks the killer will not move there after reaching the Backyard or to move to the Parking area to position himself for an escape in the following turns.

Considering the killer's next move to the Backyard area, you should move to the Forest area, which keeps you safe from the killer's current path and positions you for a potential escape through the Backyard to the Gate area in the next turn.

Action: Move to Forest area.","Analysis: Given the current situation, I believe Bob will move towards the generator in the Backyard since it is the last one remaining to be fixed. This is a common strategy to minimize the risk of attracting the killer's attention. As for my next action, I would wait in the Kitchen area to give Bob some time to repair the generator without drawing the killer's attention to me. Once the generator is fixed, we can both make our way to the Gate area and escape together.

Action: I will wait in the Kitchen area.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information you provided, the killer is moving towards the Backyard area from the Gate area. This means that neither you nor Bob is in immediate danger, as there is no path directly connecting the Gate area to the Kitchen or Warehouse areas. However, if the killer continues moving in the same direction, they could potentially reach the Warehouse area (where Bob is) in the next turn.

As for Bob's actions, I'm assuming that he will either move towards a connected area or wait in the Warehouse area. Moving towards a connected area might be a good idea if he wants to avoid the killer or help you fix the remaining generator in the Forest area. On the other hand, waiting in the Warehouse area could be a good strategy if he wants to ensure that the generator in the Warehouse area stays fixed and attract the killer's attention.

Considering the situation, I think the best action for you to take would be to move towards the Forest area. This would achieve a few things:

1. It would allow you to help fix the remaining generator in the Forest area, which would contribute to the team's goal of escaping the map.
2. It would also allow you to be in closer proximity to Bob, which would make it easier for you to coordinate your actions and communicate with each other.
3. Moving towards the Forest area would also put some distance between you and the killer, which would reduce the risk of getting caught.

Of course, if you have reason to believe that Bob is planning to move towards the Backyard area in order to distract the killer or lead them away from the Warehouse area, then you might want to consider moving towards the Parking area instead. This would allow you to meet up with Bob and potentially flank the killer together.

",CollabGames,,,,,,,,,9.0,,"I (Alice) am playing the game ""Collab Escape"". As a survivor, I must cooperate with Bob (the other survivor), and we win even if one of us escapes the map though the exit gate. The exit gate will open once all generators are fixed. Killer's attention will be attracted by survivors in rooms connected to killer's current room and move towards the seen survivor in the next turn. Strategies like diverting and luring the killer can help the survivor team win.

Environment Layout: There are 7 areas listed as follow. Forest and Warehouse areas have generators, and Gate area has the exit gate. 
- Parking area is directly connected to Warehouse and Kitchen; 
- Warehouse area is directly connected to Parking, Centerhub and Backyard; 
- Backyard area is directly connected to Warehouse, Centerhub, Gate and Forest; 
- Centerhub area is directly connected to Warehouse, Backyard and Kitchen; 
- Kitchen area is directly connected to Centerhub, Parking and Forest; 
- Forest area is directly connected to Kitchen and Backyard.
- Gate area is only directly connected to Backyard.

Connected areas are connected by pathways with same length, and you can only move to connected areas. To fix a generator, it needs multiple consecutive repair actions by the same survivor, so the survivor should help each other to ensure the fixing can be completed. Survivors cannot be caught when they are moving between areas but Survivors will get caught if they end in the same area with the killer after a turn. Only if both survivors are caught, the game ends.

In each turn, survivors and the killer simultaneously perform one action. Killer's action might be known, but survivors cannot know each other's actions ahead of time. Available actions are either move to connected areas, wait in current area, or fixing generators in the current area. 

What action should I take?

Do not say anything else. Got it?","My name is Alice. I am in Centerhub area. Bob is in Forest area. Bob was fixing the generator. Currently, we have information that the killer is now in the Backyard area following Alice. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. Generator in Forest still need 3 fixes. The exit gate is closed. Available actions: [move to Kitchen, move to Warehouse, move to Backyard, wait.]",,"Analysis: Given that the killer is following Alice and is currently in the Backyard area, it's likely that the killer will move to the Centerhub area to pursue Alice since that's the only information the killer has. Alice should therefore avoid staying in Centerhub or moving to the Backyard to prevent getting caught. Since Bob is in the Forest area and he was fixing the generator, it's reasonable to assume that Bob will continue to fix the generator, assuming he believes Alice will successfully divert the killer's attention away from him.

For the team's common good, Alice should move to an area that will not intersect with the killer's pursuit and allows Bob to safely continue fixing the generator in the Forest area. Moving to the Kitchen would be a safe bet, as it would put more distance between Alice and the killer and does not directly connect to the Backyard, where the killer currently is. This move also positions Alice to potentially fix the generator in the Forest area later on or to move towards the exit once the generator is fixed. 

Action: Move to Kitchen","Analysis: Based on the given information, it seems that Bob is prioritizing fixing the generator in the Forest area, as it is not yet completed. I can't be certain about Bob's next action, but it's likely that he will continue fixing the generator to ensure that it gets completed. As for my next action, since the killer is currently in the Backyard area, it might be a good idea for me to move to the Kitchen area to avoid being caught by the killer. This will also give me an opportunity to help Bob by fixing the generator in the Warehouse area when it's my turn again.

Action: Move to Kitchen area.</s>","Analysis: Based on the information provided, Bob is currently in the Forest area fixing the generator. The killer is aware of Alice's location and is in the Backyard area, which is directly connected to the Forest area where Bob is. Given that the killer is likely to move towards the seen survivor (Bob) in the next turn, Alice should prioritize moving towards a safer area.

Bob's best course of action in this situation would be to finish fixing the generator in the Forest area as quickly as possible and then move to the Backyard area. By doing so, Bob can create a diversion, attracting the killer's attention and providing Alice with an opportunity to move to a safer location.

Alice's best action in this situation is to move to the Warehouse area. This area has a fixed generator and is not directly connected to the Backyard area, making it a safer location for Alice. Once in the Warehouse, Alice can wait and coordinate with Bob to determine their next steps.

Currently, we have information that the killer is now in the Kitchen area. Generator in Warehouse is fixed. The exit gate is closed. Available Actions: [move to Kitchen, move to Backyard, fix generator in Forest, wait.]",,"Analysis: Given your current position in the Forest area and the killer's location in the Kitchen area, it is likely that the killer will move towards the Warehouse area, as that is the only fixed generator and the killer might expect Bob to be there. Since Bob is in the Warehouse and the generator there is already fixed, his best move would be to avoid the killer. Bob might anticipate the killer's move towards him and choose to either move to the Centerhub or the Backyard to stay safe. As for you, Alice, since you are one fix away from completing the generator in the Forest, it is crucial for you to finish repairing it, as it will bring you one step closer to opening the exit gate. Since the killer is currently in the Kitchen, you are safe to continue your repair, as the killer cannot reach you in one turn. 

Bob's best move is to relocate to an area that is not connected to the Kitchen to avoid crossing paths with the killer. Moving to the Backyard could be a strategic choice because it connects to the Gate area. However, if he anticipates that you will finish the generator this turn, he might choose to wait in the Warehouse or move to the Parking area to position himself closer to the exit gate once it opens.

Action: Fix generator in Forest.","Analysis: Since the killer is currently in the Kitchen area, it is unlikely that Bob will move towards the Kitchen as the killer's attention may be attracted to him. Hence, I predict that Bob will either fix the generator in Warehouse or wait in Warehouse. As for my action, since the generator in Forest needs only one more fix, I will move towards the Forest area to help Bob finish fixing it. This will ensure that we can open the exit gate and increase our chances of escaping together.

Action: Move towards Forest area.</s>","Analysis: Given that the killer is in the Kitchen area, they are not directly connected to Bob in the Warehouse area. The generator in the Forest area only needs one more fix, which Alice can complete in this turn. Bob, being in the Warehouse area, has no further use in fixing any generators since all generators are already fixed. If Bob moves to the Gate area, it would risk attracting the killer's attention, especially if the killer decides to move towards the generator sounds. Instead, Bob should move towards Alice, as the killer is in the Kitchen area and cannot directly reach either of them.

Bob's best action: Move to Backyard.

Action: Fix generator in Forest, then move to Backyard in the following turn.

Fixing the generator in the Forest area will ensure that all generators are fixed, opening the exit gate. After completing the generator fix, Alice should move to the Backyard area to join Bob, as the killer's attention is on the Kitchen area.

Since you are holding nothing and Bob is holding an onion, it would be efficient for Bob to place his onion in the cooker. Assuming Bob will place his onion in the cooker, which he is likely to do because it's the next step in the recipe, the cooker will then have the correct ingredients and can be turned on. As for your action, since you are not holding anything and the cooker will soon have the correct ingredients, it would be a good idea to prepare for the next steps after the soup starts cooking. Picking up a plate would be a sensible choice so that once the soup is cooked, it can be plated immediately without delay.

",CollabGames,,,,,,,,,17.0,Shared Counter,"In the game CollabCooking you are Alice and your partner is Bob. We must coordinate to make onion soups with 2 onions and 1 tomato. Once a soup is cooked it needs to be placed on a plate and delivered. You should start cooking for subsequent deliveries preemptively. You can only carry one item at a time. Your goal is to maximize the number of deliveries. You have access to onions, tomatoes and plates while Bob has access to cookers and the delivery area. You can use a shared counter for passing necessary objects. 

I will provide you the state information, including your position, Bob's position, and the status of cookers and soups. Help me select the best action from the list of actions provided. In general actions will require your to pick or place onions, tomatoes, plates and soups or move. There are kitchen counters around you which can be used to store items temporarily.

Available actions: [pick up onion, pick up tomato, pick up plate, wait]",,"Analysis: Since you are currently not holding anything and Bob is holding a tomato, the next logical step for you is to contribute to the soup currently cooking. The cooker has 2 onions but is off, which means it needs a tomato to complete the recipe for the onion soup. Since Bob is holding a tomato, it is likely that he will place the tomato in the cooker next. Therefore, your best move is to prepare for the next steps after the current soup is cooking. Picking up a plate would be the most strategic action as you will need it to serve the cooked soup once it's ready. This will streamline the process and make sure you are ready to plate the soup as soon as it's done cooking.

Action: pick up plate","Analysis: Bob is likely to start cooking the tomato since he is holding it and the cooker is available. I will pick up an onion to be ready to cook as soon as Bob finishes his soup.

Action: pick up onion.</s>","Analysis: Bob is holding a tomato, which means that he can start cooking soup as soon as he has access to an onion and a cooker. Right now, the cooker has 2 onions, so Bob doesn't need me to pick up an onion. Instead, I can pick up an onion from the cooker and place it on the counter, so that Bob can easily access it when he's ready to start cooking. This will also free up the cooker for me to use later. Since I can only carry one item at a time, I will pick up the onion first and then pick up the plate.

Action: Pick up onion, pick up plate.</s>","Theory of Mind, Partner Aware Planning",C
