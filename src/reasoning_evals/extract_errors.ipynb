       " ' Answer: A. No, we can get to the gate perfectly fine.\\n\\nExplanation: Since the killer is in room 7 and the exit gate is in room 1 (connected to room 7), and we have already fixed the generators, Alice and Bob can safely make their way to the exit gate and escape without the need to lure the killer away.',\n",
       " \" Answer: C. Not enough information.\\n\\nExplanation: Since the killer is in the Backyard area, which is connected to the Gate area, there is no need for the survivors to lure the killer away to access the gate, as long as they can reach it before or at the same time as the killer. However, without knowing their exact positions and movement possibilities in the next turn, it's impossible to confirm that for certain.\",\n",

Not enough information.\\n\\nExplanation: In order to determine if Bob can deliver the soup on his own, we need to know the location of the delivery area d0 in relation to Bob.
