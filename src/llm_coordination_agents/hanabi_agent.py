        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack.

        1. **Card Layout:**
            - Cards are added to the right; the oldest card is on the left.
            - Positions are referenced from left to right.
        2. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        3. **Play Clue:**
            - A play clue is revealing a card or cards in partners hand that are immediately playable on the stack by indicating their rank or color.
        4. **Save Clue**
            - A save clue is used to save rank 5 cards, unique rank 2 cards and critical cards (only one of the kind left) 
        5. **Do Not Repeat Known Information**
            - If a player already knows the color of their card, do not repeat the color in a clue. If a player already knows the rank of their card, do not repeat the rank in a clue.
        5. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        6. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        7. **Play with Fear:**
            - You should take risks and play a card even though you are not completely sure when you have 2 or 3 lives left. However when you have only 1 life left you should play a card only when you are sure that is goes next on the stack. '''

        2. **Chop Card:**
            - The left-most unclued card is the "chop" card. An unclued card is one whose color/rank can be anything (RYGWB12345). 
            - The default discard action is to discard the chop card.
        3. **Clues:**
            - Two types of clues: Play Clue (play the card) and Save Clue (save for later).
            - If a valid Play Clue or Save Clue can't be given, players must discard.
        4. **Play Clue:**
            - Indicates a card is playable.
            - Can be delayed if it's playable after other cards are played.
        5. **Save Clue:**
            - Indicates to save a card, typically given to chop cards.
            - Focus on saving 5's, unique 2's, and critical cards.
            - Number clues (2 or 5) are used for saving 2's and 5's.
            - Critical cards are the last unplayed card of a suit and value.
        7. **Clue Interpretation Algorithm:**
            - When a clue happens and you need to figure out what it means, always ask yourself the following questions: 1. What card is focused? 2. Is it a Play Clue or a Save Clue or could it still be either? - Clues that do not concern chop cards are always Play Clues. - Chop clues can be either a Play Clue or a Save Clue. 3. What is the identity of the card?
        8. **Good Touch Principle:**
            - Only clue cards that will eventually be played.
        9. **Save Principle:**
            - Prevent discarding of critical and unique playable cards.
            - Most important principle, can override others if necessary.
        10. **Minimum Clue Value Principle:**
            - Restricts clue giving to Play Clues for playable cards and Save Clues for critical cards.
        11. **Early Game:**
            - Focus on using all available Play and Save Clues before the first discard.
        12. **Check Team Chops:**
            - Prioritize checking your partnerâ€™s chop cards at the start of your turn.
        13. **Prioritize Play Clues over Save Clues:**
            - Prefer giving Play Clues if both are viable options.
        14. **Discard Without Fear:**
            - Discard confidently, as saving important cards is a team responsibility.
        15. **Play with Fear:**
            - Do not play a card unless you know for sure that it goes next on the stack when you only have 1 life token left. '''
